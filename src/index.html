                  Meet Bolt Crank, mercenary extraordinaire, and the man who
                  eats metal! Through his travels, he stops along the way to
                  make a few bucks and occasionally rescue damsels in distress.
                  His taste for metal gives him quite an edge as he becomes
                  capable of generating an assortment of weapons from his hand!
                  It's a strange ability, but it seems to come in handy, so to
                  speak. Bolt has an edge over his adversaries, but will that be
                  enough?
